## Areas for Improvement

### Design & Visual Appeal

- **Content flow**: Dense text blocks could benefit from better visual hierarchy
- **Interactive elements**: Limited engagement beyond basic hover effects
- **Mobile experience**: Functional but could be more touch-friendly

### Technical Implementation
- **CSS organization**: All styles in one file, could be modularized
- **Animation library**: Uses basic CSS animations, could leverage modern libraries
- **Performance**: Could optimize for faster loading

### Content Presentation
- **Hero section**: Strong headline but visual impact is minimal
- **Feature cards**: Functional but lack visual appeal
- **Testimonials**: Basic design doesn't build trust effectively
- **Science section**: Important content but presented as dense text
